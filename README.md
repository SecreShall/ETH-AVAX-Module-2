# SimpleWallet Smart Contract with 3 functions

## Overview

SimpleWallet is a Solidity smart contract that allows for basic management of ether within an Ethereum wallet. It provides functionalities for depositing ether, withdrawing ether (restricted to the owner), and checking the current balance of the contract.

## Features

- Deposit ether into the contract.
- Withdraw ether from the contract (owner only).
- Check the current balance of the contract.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the contract:

1. **Deployment**: Deploy `SimpleWallet.sol` on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. **Interaction**:
   - Use the `deposit` function to add ether to the contract.
   - Use the `withdraw` function (accessible only to the contract owner) to withdraw ether.
   - Use the `getBalance` function to retrieve the current balance.

## Usage

Ensure you have an Ethereum development environment set up (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat) to deploy and interact with the contract.

## Security

- Ensure only trusted entities control the owner address.
- Validate inputs to prevent errors and potential vulnerabilities.
